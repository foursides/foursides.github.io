Title: A Potential Change
Date: 2013-06-09 09:00

After receiving an incredible amount of emails notifying me that people have been trying to gain access to my blog (on Wordpress), I thought I would seek out alternatives. I first contemplated setting up my own blog on a spare desktop computer, but I realized how cumbersome the process actually is. 

I'm not that much of a geek.

Instead, I have been curating my 300+ posts and transferring the stuff I am most proud of here. The domain [foursides.ca](http://www.foursides.ca "Four Sides") will get redirected here eventually and I will bundle up the other posts into a PDF for those people who really want to read everything I have to offer. 

Take a look, try it on different mobile devices, and send me your thoughts on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/four_sides "Four_Sides") or on Facebook. 

More later.[^1]

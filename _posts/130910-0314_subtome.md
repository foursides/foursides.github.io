I added a **Subscribe** button to the top of the page, courtesy of [SubToMe](http://www.subtome.com "SubToMe"). 

It's a pretty nifty service that allows people to choose which RSS feed service they would like to use to follow your site. A quick paste of code on your site and you're done. 

Conversely, there is a simple Subscribe button you can drag into your browser bar to subscribe to other site's feeds that don't have a subscribe button (i.e. [Tumblr](http://sheepfarm.tumblr.com "Tumblr").)

Great stuff.

When the release of The 4 Hour Body ([short review](http://jamesmccullough.hubpages.com/hub/The-4-Hour-Body-Review-Tim-Ferriss "The 4 Hour Body | Short Review")) was quickly approaching in December, I noticed something happening across several of the blogs I followed. A lot of them not only had interviews with Timothy Ferriss that mentioned the book, they were including sample chapters.  Only after reading the book did I realize how complete these chapters actually were.

I thought it would be beneficial for someone to gather all of these links into one spot for people to browse and decide once and for all whether the book is worth buying.

Please note, I do not advocate piracy of any nature, but all the chapters listed below are links to material published by Mr. Ferriss on his blog or on others. Please also note that the material published online is not 100% the same as the book. You will be able to discover the tips of the ice berg for a lot of the ideas found in the book, but will have to read the book to get the full value of that information. Some of the links are also to the original posts on Mr. Ferriss’ blog, so the information is the same, but the style of writing is a bit different.

As other sections are discovered, I will add them here.

Also be sure to check out Tim Ferriss’ latest book: [The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547884591/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0547884591&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20 "THe 4 Hour Chef")

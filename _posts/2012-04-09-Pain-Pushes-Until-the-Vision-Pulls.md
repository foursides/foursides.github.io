[Lori Painter](http://www.lifebylori.com/pushed-by-pain-until-pulled-by-a-vision) posted a wonderful video sharing the story of her life, and how painful it was for her five years ago. The message throughout the video resonated with me so much that I needed to share it. 
<p>
My life has been rather turbelent the past few years, and painful when it reached the low points. Pain is relative to a personâ€™s experiences, and I know my pain could have been much, much worse, but it was still a difficult experience for me to go through then, and now. The past month or so, I have found myself caught up more in what was going on in my life or had gone on than working towards improving my situation. I keep living day to day hoping something would change, but it never will change until I make the changes myself. 
<p>
Towards the end of the video, Lori talks about how to discover this vision. One of the requirements is to be quiet, to slow down life. I have certainly been doing that this past weekend, keeping to myself while my daughter is away and focusing on doing some writing that I had meant to do a while ago. No grand vision as of yet, though I can sense things are starting to bubble in mind.

If you are looking for a little inspiration, click thru and watch her video. It is only twelve minutes long or so, and she includes the video that helped inspire her vision.

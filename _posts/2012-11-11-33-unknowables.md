<blockquote>It seems strange to me now to think about how I have to unlearn how I lived in my 20s to really live now.</blockquote>
33

As cool as it would have been turning 33 on 11/11/11, I suppose it will be just as meaningful happening on 11/11/12. I was re-reading through last year's <a href="http://scriptogr.am/foursides/post/turn-up-that-fing-bass-32-years-old-today">birthday</a> post earlier in the week, reflecting on what I would like to write this year. Oddly, I didn't write on my birthdays before last year, so this is a new trend that is starting.

The cliche thing to do would be to write about "33 Things You Don't Know About Me" or "33 Life Lessons I Have Learned Through the Year," but I am never one to fit in with the popular trends. While thinking more about how I have been unlearning things about life to enjoy life more the past few years, I came to the realization of how much more meaningful it is to have those mysteries in life, those things you simply can't know about.

Growing up, I devoured books to learn as much as I could. Now, it's devouring things on the internet through searches, watching YouTube videos, and constantly consuming. Even with as much information I have been swallowing up, there are still things I will never know about and now I never <em>want</em> to know about them.

17. Knowing what it's like to see a ball game in some of the historical fields of the past (Polo Grounds, Tiger Stadium, Comiskey).

23. What my life would be like if I stayed in theatre.
24. What my life would be like without an easy source to write (i.e. before writing was general knowledge).

29. What my daughter will think 20-30 years from now when she reads the archives or whether she will be able to.
30. What people far in the future will think of us sharing images of cats, images with huge captions written across them, or people dancing to Gangnam Style.
31. Whether I will look through the thousands of pictures I have in the future and remember the details as clearly as my grandparents do now while in their 80s.
32. Why my daughter refuses to sleep during the times I want her to but finds a way to doze off when I don't want her to.
33. What my daughter is thinking when she is smiling at me.

A lengthy list. One that will surely grow as I grow older and give up trying to learn/experience everything that I can.

To finish off, one of my favourite tracks right now:

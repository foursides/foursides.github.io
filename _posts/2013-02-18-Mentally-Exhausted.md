<blockquote>I'm not particularly stressed, I'm not particularly overwhelmed. I'm not even mad, but for the past week I have just been feeling bored.</blockquote>
â€“ Ben Brooks, <a title="Mentally Fatigued | Ben Brooks" href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/tired-ben/">Mentally Fatigued</a>

Unlike Ben, I am feeling quite stressed, but I can definitely relate to his feelings of boredom.

I can never quite pin-down <em>exactly</em> what is happening. I will scan through Twitter, or Facebook, or the RSS feeds and mentally throw my hands up in the air and give up. Very little captures my interest so intently that I want to explore further into a topic and gets me excited to share it with everyone. I almost want to take that drastic measure of nuking everything and starting over. I know better to do that, however, because I know it won't solve my problem.

I am likely to build myself up to the same point in time only to get frustrated again and want to renew myself.

Ben's solution is to take a break. Others take a digital sabbatical.

I could never completely detach myself from the digital world, mainly because my job depends on it. Taking a mental break would be welcomed. This is fitting considering we are in the period of Lent.

With this in mind, I will strive to do a few things over the next month:
<ol>
	<li>Stop reading the Twitter stream, and only interact with it through updates, mentions, direct messages.</li>
	<li>Same thing with Facebook. This may be a great break from seeing all the inspriational/funny graphics polluting the internet.</li>
	<li>Condense my reading of Google Reader to scanning at the end of the week, not daily, and liberally use "Mark All as Read."</li>
	<li>Do more slow reads to fully understand longform pieces and read more outside of my own home.</li>
	<li>Write more, in generally.</li>
</ol>
We will see how well this goes for me. I naturally retreat to reading online when stressed out so it will be a challenge to not pick up the phone to scan Twitter and such.

Who else is participating by giving up something during Lent?

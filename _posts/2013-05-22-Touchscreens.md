> What I find incredibly exciting about this is the interfaces people who grew up with touchscreen devices design could be very different than the ones we design. The user interfaces designed thus far for touch devices are still in large part based on concepts from the PC. That will not be true for the next generation.

I’ve been watching my two yearold daughter interact with my MacBook, my Android device, and my iPad and have noticed how quickly she has mastered the iPad compared to my phone and computer. To me, using a mouse and keyboard is still feels right, while using my iPad sans keyboard feels strange to me. Having bought a keyboard for it, it makes it slightly more useful for me. My daughter seems to presume that everything is touch-based. She wants to touch the MacBook screen to maneuver objects, tries to swipe on a digital camera screen, and thinks every phone is controlled through touch. 

As most parents do, I think about the future she’s going to be living. Most of my thoughts have been how different her social interactions are going to be (i.e. living in a world with unlimited text messaging through iPhones or Facebook Messenger, little to no email, fewer phonecalls), but I never thought much about how she would be interacting with technology. 

After reading [Chuck Skoda](http://chuckskoda.com/entry/the-touchscreens-are-coming/)’s post that Kyle links to, I find myself wondering to what extent are touchscreens going to grow in this world. And as touch has become more entrenched in our society the past five years, will voice enabled devices (Siri, Google’s Project Glass) become as prevelant?

It’s going to be an exciting future.

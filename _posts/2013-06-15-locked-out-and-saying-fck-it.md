> When you say *Fuck It*, you give in to the flow of life - you stop doing what you don't want to do, you finally do what you've always wanted to do, and you stop listening to people and listen to yourself.

Parkin, [Fuck It: The Ultimate Spiritual Way](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401927599/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1401927599&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20 "Fuck It - John C Parkin")<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup>

I stopped writing on this site back in February. I was becoming rather frustrated in the amount of ideas flowing around in my head and struggling to get them published. I thought I had perfected my writing work flow to the point where I couldn't possibly change anything more about it. I was able to publish from my iPhone, my iPad, my computer easily. 

Thought --> Device --> Blog

Then I started experiencing hiccups. Things didn't look *right* on my site or I would experience an error in publishing. The more frustrated I was, the less motivated I was to tackle the problems and get moving again. The solution was always lingering in the back of my mind since I started reading more "geeky" writers who were publishing on either their own platforms or using something freely available that wasn't Wordpress, Tumblr, and so forth. I knew I would probably feel more motivated to write if I experienced less friction overall. 

Instead of fixing things, I just stopped. 

Every now and then I would glance at the domain, let out a sigh, then close the browser and move onto something else. This went on for months. I would read further about how people transferred their sites onto new platforms, get into the manuals to discover how I could go about it, even setting up some of these platforms on an old PC to prove to myself that I could get it working. 

Getting those platforms set up properly proved more challenging than I expected, and only caused more friction with the flow of work, so I stopped delving into that area. 

The turning point was receiving emails saying bots were trying to log into my Wordpress account. The IP addresses kept changing so I couldn't find a reliable way to block them out completely. Without finding a good solution for that, the result was I was denied access to my account because of all the failed attempts to log in. It always boggles my mind that illegitimate attempts to log in denied the legitimate attempts completely. 

I could still view my site, of course, but publishing something new was impossible. Wordpress denied all access to my blog regardless of the method I was using. It forced me to either keep fighting these bots or say, "Fuck it," and move to a new platform with all the problems that come with it. 

So, I said, "Fuck it," and broke my site. 

The one time I was able to access my site, I exported all the posts, converted them into Markdown, and then decided what to do. I discovered [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am "Scriptogr.am") by pure accident. My favourite writing application, [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Qt "Byword"), had received an update that allowed publishing to various blog platforms. Scriptogr.am was one of the options, which prompted me to explore it, put some posts up and see how it performed. 

The short answer is I liked it enough to keep pushing to make it work, which leads me to the current status of the site. There are roughly 35 posts out of the nearly 300 I had on the Wordpress domain. I curated this first batch because they represented what I felt was the most useful writing and stuff I enjoyed reading again myself. I am sure I will be adding more to it as time goes on. Definitely not the same amount of bloat as the other site. 

Otherwise, not much else will change. Posts will still appear on Facebook and Twitter, be found through search engines and so forth. Less worrying about appearance, and more focus on the words.  

I still am the same person as I was before, after all:

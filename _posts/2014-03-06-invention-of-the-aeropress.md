> Among coffee aficionados, the AeroPress is a revelation. A small, $30 plastic device that resembles a plunger makes what many consider to be the best cup of coffee in the world. Proponents of the device claim that drinks made with the AeroPress are more delicious than those made with thousand-dollar machines. Perhaps best of all, the AeroPress seems to magically clean itself during the extraction process. 
>
> There’s really nothing bad to say about the device other than the fact that it’s a funny-looking plastic thingy. Then again, its inventor, Stanford professor Alan Adler, is a world renowned inventor of funny-looking plastic thingies; while Adler’s Palo Alto based company Aerobie is best known today for its coffee makers, the firm rose to prominence in the 1980s for its world-record-setting flying discs.

> This is the story of how Adler and Aerobie dispelled the notion of industry-specific limitations and found immense success in two disparate industries: toys and coffee.

A great read about the inventor of the Aerobie and the [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B0047BIWSK&linkCode=shr&tag=four0b-20&qid=1394149659&sr=8-1&keywords=aeropress "Aeropress on Amazon") - the best damn way to make coffee<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup>. I have been using it for over two years now and love how easy it is to: 

1. Brew coffee with.
2. Clean up the mess afterwards.

It's so simple, even my 4 year old daughter helps me with all the steps, from grinding and putting the beans in, brewing the coffee, and the clean up afterwards.

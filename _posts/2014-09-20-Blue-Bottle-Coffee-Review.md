I have been subscribing to [Tonx Coffee](http://www.foursides.ca/Tonx-Review/ "Tonx Coffee Review") for several years now. Earlier in 2014, it was announced that Tonx would be joining [Blue Bottle Coffee][B]. The fortunate thing is the coffee subscription service wasn't going to be changing that much, only the branding. 

The changes that are happening are going to make things even better. Below is more information about the subscription service, and a list of the coffees I am receiving to give you an idea of the flavours to be expected when signing up. The original list of coffees delivered by Tonx will remain on my site, as [Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is still continuing on their tradition of delivering coffees from around the world. 

### Blue Bottle Coffee

[Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is an independent operation based out of California. They have both coffee shops there, but also coffee subscription services that sends the best coffee or espresso from their roasters to your door for a low price. With the addition of the Tonx team, Blue Bottle Coffee truly the best damn coffee out there. </p>

<p>I live in southern British Columbia in Canada, which besides a lot of wineries and orchards, has several coffee roasters here. I have tried almost all of the various blends, on top of the national chains (<a rel="nofollow"  href="http://goo.gl/KUccF" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.blenz.com" title="Blenz">Blenz</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.secondcup.com" title="Second Cup">Second Cup</a>, etc.) and have been unable to find something that really appealed to me day in, day out. I may find one blend I enjoy, but then end up sticking to it all the time. There was no variety. </p>

Until I subscribed to [Blue Bottle Coffee][B].

Blue Bottle Coffee gives you that variety if you desire it, or a certain bean type on a regular basis with consisten flavours.</p>

###Subscription Options

With Tonx, you only had two choices: a small bag of coffee, or a larger one. With Blue Bottle Coffee, you have endless possibilities. 

- **Origins Subscription**: A delicious new single origin offering from Latin America, East Africa, or the Pacific Islands.
- **Blend Subscription**: A changing selection of our blends, each one with its own origin story and profile.
- **Espresso Subscription**: A melange of our espresso offerings, including blends and single origins that we serve in our cafes.
- a choice of 7 other coffee roasts on a regular basis. 

With each subscription, you will eventually get to choose the frequency (every week, every other week, once a month, etc.) And like Tonx, you will get a few size options as well. 

- 6 oz is $13 for Origins Subscription ($12 for others)
- 12 oz is $21 for Origins Subscription ($19 for others)

Once you have the option to have shipments arrive once a month, the 12 oz bag is going to clealry be the best option. 

### The Coffees

- **Hayes Valley Espresso**: Cocoa, orange zest, smoky finish.
- **Decaf Noir**: Nutty, chocolaty, dense.

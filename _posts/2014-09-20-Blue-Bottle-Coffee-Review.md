I have been subscribing to [Tonx Coffee](http://www.foursides.ca/Tonx-Review/ "Tonx Coffee Review") for several years now. Earlier in 2014, it was announced that Tonx would be joining [Blue Bottle Coffee][B]. The fortunate thing is the coffee subscription service wasn't going to be changing that much, only the branding. 

The changes that are happening are going to make things even better. Below is more information about the subscription service, and a list of the coffees I am receiving to give you an idea of the flavours to be expected when signing up. The original list of coffees delivered by Tonx will remain on my site, as [Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is still continuing on their tradition of delivering coffees from around the world. 

### Blue Bottle Coffee

[Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is an independent operation based out of California. They have both coffee shops there, but also coffee subscription services that sends the best coffee or espresso from their roasters to your door for a low price. With the addition of the Tonx team, Blue Bottle Coffee truly the best damn coffee out there. </p>

<p>I live in southern British Columbia in Canada, which besides a lot of wineries and orchards, has several coffee roasters here. I have tried almost all of the various blends, on top of the national chains (<a rel="nofollow"  href="http://goo.gl/KUccF" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.blenz.com" title="Blenz">Blenz</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.secondcup.com" title="Second Cup">Second Cup</a>, etc.) and have been unable to find something that really appealed to me day in, day out. I may find one blend I enjoy, but then end up sticking to it all the time. There was no variety. </p>

Until I subscribed to [Blue Bottle Coffee][B].

Blue Bottle Coffee gives you that variety if you desire it, or a certain bean type on a regular basis with consistent flavours.</p>

### Guatemala La Bolsa el Cabro

**Details:** Purchased in 1958 by Dr. Jorge Vides, Finca La Bolsa is among the most progressive coffee operations in Guatemala. Before Vides passed away in 1995, he was a longtime director of the National Hospital in Guatemala City, which now bears his name. Today, his socially-minded imprint lives on through numerous farm programs: nutritious menus for pickers’ children, a school, first aid trainings, and nurse evaluations. 

**Deliciousness:** Plum, juicy, milk, chocolate, clean.

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">

With such ideal growing conditions and commitment to quality, Hunkute is a long-standing favourite of our sourcing team. 

**Deliciousness:** Peach, melon, delicate

**Details:** Run by Erasto Weneza and co-owned by local farmers, the Mwasa washing station is a glimpse into Rwanda’s bright coffee-growing future. Thanks to geographic conditions like mineral-rich volcanic soil and winds from nearby Lake Kivu, this washed coffee is bursting with sweet, deeply fruited flavours. 

**Deliciousness:** Peach, brown sugar, date.

### Costa Rica Santa Rosa 1900 La Plaza

**Details:** Finca La Plaza is one of three coffee farms run by the Naranjo family. It is situated adjacent to the Santa Rosa 1900 microbial, so named for its elevation (in meters above sea level). Production is a longer process at this elevation, where tree growth, cherry ripening and drying take significantly longer than they do at lower farms. These factors allow the Naranjo family to employ careful and deliberate methods, producing a coffee we are thrilled to offer. 

**Deliciousness:** Almond paste, kiwi, honey

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">
![](BBC12.png)
</a>

### Colombia Cerro Azul Gesha

**Details:** Nestled in the Valle del Cauca region of Colombia, Cerro Azul is known for its Gesha, especially since it is the only varietal they grow on the farm (30,000 trees- all Gesha!). Advanced climate tracking technology provides farmers with detailed information about factors such as rainfall, sun, and wind so that they can optimize their harvest.

**Deliciousness:** Sparkling, jasmine, plum

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">
![](BBC11.png)

### Panama Emporium Estate Natural

**Details:** Panama’s Emporium Estate (formerly Dona Berta), is owned and handily managed by Graciano Cruz. Having placed in the Top 10 coffees in the annual Panama’s Best competition in past years, it’s no wonder that Emporium continues to surprise and delight us. Their signature naturals are meticulously processed on African-style raised beds.

**Deliciousness:** Blackberry, plum, tropical

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">

### Peru Puno San Jorge

**Details:** Located in the Sandia Valley of Puno, Peru’s southernmost province, San Jorge is one of eight cooperatives that make up the Central Agricultural Cooperative of the Sandia Valley (CECOVASA), which oversees a membership of 4,700 farmers. As most of the farms are on the smaller side, nearly all of the coffee is picked by the farmers themselves, sometimes with the help of neighbours.

**Deliciousness:** Balanced, milk chocolate, cherry cola

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">
![](BBC19.png)
</a>

### Rwanda Nyanza Iwacu

**Details:** Iwacu, which means “our place,” is run by a gentleman named Uwizeye, who formerly managed coffee washing stations for Rwanda’s Ministry of Defense. During the growing season, he manages nearly 2,000 farmers. Uwizeye and his team are very committed to sustainability, their machine utilizes pressure instead of water to de-pulp cherries.

**Deliciousness:** Red currant, lemon, nectarine.

### Kenya Embu Gikirima

The farmer’s producers apply a meticulous hand to their fermenting, drying, conditioning, and storing operations. Part of the Kibugu Farmers Cooperative, Gikirima produces some of the most delicious coffee Kenya has to offer.

**Deliciousness:** Blackberry, mandarin orange, vibrant

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">

</a>

**Details:** La Boisa, so named for the bag-shaped topography that the farm sits in, was purchased by Dr. Jorge Vides M.D., in 1958. With great elevation and a small river running through the property, the land is ideal for growing and processing coffee. Dr. Vides highly valued the health of his employees, and implemented a number of programs to ensure it, before he passed away in 1995. The farm is now managed by his daughter, Maria Elena Vides. 

**Deliciousness:** Plum, grapefruit, creamy

### Brazil Minas Gerais Carmo Select

**Details:** Nestled in Brazil’s Mantiqueira mountains, both Fazenda Ignacio Pereira and Fazenda do Serrano are overseen by the Sertao Group and the Pereira family. This Yellow Bourbon variety is a pulped-natural coffee, meaning that the skin and some of the sticky mucilate are removed mechanically before beans are laid out to dry. 

**Deliciousness:** Chocolate mousse, almond, red apple

<a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/u/foursides">
![](BBC21.png)
</a>

**Details:** Fourth-generation farmer Mauricio Vindas Vargas named his farm Divino Nino in honour of his son, who recovered from a serious childhood illness. They say gratitude reaps rewards, but we know hard work does, too. Marco bought these 12 hectares in Costa Rica’s Tarrazu region with money he earned as a cook. He planted 5,000 Cattura and Catui trees and dries the beans in the sun. Whatever the reason, Divino Nino is getting its due. This year, it nabbed its first Cup of Excellence award. 

**Deliciousness:** Toffee, vanilla, currant

### Malawi Misuku Hills Mzuzu

**Details:** The Mzuzu Coffee Farmer’s Cooperative works with 3000 producers from six villages in northern Malawi. The co-op places an impressive and inspiring emphasis on rural and social development, with a focus on improving food and housing security, education, and opportunities for women. When the co-op’s not improving farmers’ lives, it’s helping them produce gorgeous coffees like this one.

**Deliciousness:** Cola, tamarind, syrupy

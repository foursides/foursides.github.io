I have been subscribing to [Tonx Coffee](http://www.foursides.ca/Tonx-Review/ "Tonx Coffee Review") for several years now. Earlier in 2014, it was announced that Tonx would be joining [Blue Bottle Coffee][B]. The fortunate thing is the coffee subscription service wasn't going to be changing that much, only the branding. 

The changes that are happening are going to make things even better. Below is more information about the subscription service, and a list of the coffees I am receiving to give you an idea of the flavours to be expected when signing up. The original list of coffees delivered by Tonx will remain on my site, as [Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is still continuing on their tradition of delivering coffees from around the world. 

### Blue Bottle Coffee

[Blue Bottle Coffee][B] is an independent operation based out of California. They have both coffee shops there, but also coffee subscription services that sends the best coffee or espresso from their roasters to your door for a low price. With the addition of the Tonx team, Blue Bottle Coffee truly the best damn coffee out there. </p>

<p>I live in southern British Columbia in Canada, which besides a lot of wineries and orchards, has several coffee roasters here. I have tried almost all of the various blends, on top of the national chains (<a rel="nofollow"  href="http://goo.gl/KUccF" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.blenz.com" title="Blenz">Blenz</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.secondcup.com" title="Second Cup">Second Cup</a>, etc.) and have been unable to find something that really appealed to me day in, day out. I may find one blend I enjoy, but then end up sticking to it all the time. There was no variety. </p>

Until I subscribed to [Blue Bottle Coffee][B].

Blue Bottle Coffee gives you that variety if you desire it, or a certain bean type on a regular basis with consisten flavours.</p>

###Subscription Options

With Tonx, you only had two choices: a small bag of coffee, or a larger one. With Blue Bottle Coffee, you have endless possibilities. 

- **Origins Subscription**: A delicious new single origin offering from Latin America, East Africa, or the Pacific Islands.
- **Blend Subscription**: A changing selection of our blends, each one with its own origin story and profile.
- **Espresso Subscription**: A melange of our espresso offerings, including blends and single origins that we serve in our cafes.
- a choice of 7 other coffee roasts on a regular basis. 

With each subscription, you will eventually get to choose the frequency (every week, every other week, once a month, etc.) And like Tonx, you will get a few size options as well. 

- 6 oz is $13 for Origins Subscription ($12 for others)
- 12 oz is $21 for Origins Subscription ($19 for others)

Once you have the option to have shipments arrive once a month, the 12 oz bag is going to clealry be the best option. 

### The Coffees

The other options available:

- **Hayes Valley Espresso**: Cocoa, orange zest, smoky finish.
- **Decaf Noir**: Nutty, chocolaty, dense.
- **Bella Donovan**: Heavy, comforting, deeply fruited.
- **Three Africans**: Fruity, radiant, creamy.
- **Giant Steps**: Viscous, fudgy, substantial.
- **17ft Ceiling**: Effulgent, caramelly, enveloping, nutty.
- **Roman Espresso**: Jammy, malted, medium-bodied

### Subscription Coffees Received

**Details**: Roger Esaú Herrera Ortéz and his family of seven are responsible for some of the most delicious coffee Nicaragua has to offer. Their farm, Buena Vista, is located on the Cerror de la Explosion in San Fernando de Nueva Segovia. This selection is pulped, fermented, and washed on the farm before it is transferred to Beneficio La Estrella, in nearby Ocotal, to be dried and prepared for export.

**Deliciousness**: Nougat, cocoa, mixed berry, pear

</a>

**Details**: Beneficio Santa Rosa is perched high in the mountains of Santa Rosa de León Cortés, in central Costa Rica. Owned and managed by the father and son team of Efraín and Herberth Naranjo, the farm and mill are modestly sized and impeccably run. After pulping and mechanically demucilaging the fruit from each tiny harvest, the Naranjos lay their parchment coffee out to dry on well-monitored raised beds.

**Deliciousness**: Nectarine, watermelon, strawberry shortcake, maple.

**Details**: Thanks to her scupulous attention to picking and processing, along with her savvy across all levels of the coffee supply chain, Aida Batlle has become the first of a new breed: coffee producer as culinary celebrity. Cherries from Finca Tanzania are hand-selected for their ultra-ripe "blood red and burgundy" coloration, then processed at J. Hill, an unparalleled facility in downtown Santa Ana.

**Deliciousness**: Caramel, maple, brown sugar, fig

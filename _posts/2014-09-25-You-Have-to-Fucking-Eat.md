The next children's book to follow the best-seller, [Go the Fuck to Sleep](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617750255/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1617750255&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=EB56CXWS2WNK5FQI "Go the Fuck to Sleep"), is coming out this November. The first one was absolutely hilarious and every parents could relate to it (especially new parents going through that stage.) Definitely check out the audio recording of the book done by none other than [Samuel L Jackson]("http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JL79PC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007JL79PC&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=K4A6BYKA6IHP6AGY "Go the Fuck to Sleep - Audio Book").

[BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2014/09/24/you-have-to-fucking-eat-from.html "BoingBoing") had a preview page posted, and if the rest of the book is anything like this one page, I think it's a definite purchase for me.

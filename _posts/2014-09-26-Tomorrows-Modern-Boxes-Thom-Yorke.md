Thom Yorke, of RadioHead, has released a new album via BitTorrent. There are four tracks for download that are free, the remainder cost $6.00 to purchase. It's a creative way to distribute an album and has been downloading nearly 50,000 times already. Likely a better way to get the album out after the debacle that occured with [U2's album release via iTunes](http://www.fastcompany.com/3035787/fast-feed/u2-haters-rejoice-new-album-can-be-deleted-from-itunes-with-one-click "U2 Album Can Be Deleted from iTunes"). 

[RadioHead](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&keywords=radiohead&linkCode=ur2&qid=1411758615&rh=n%3A30%2Ck%3Aradiohead&rnid=2941120011&tag=four0b-20&linkId=635UIX6BK5HRWWFZ "Radiohead") was one of my favourite bands as a teenager. Youth around the world related to their song *[Creep](http://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk "Creep | YouTube")* and requested it so much that they had to pull it from their set lists while on tour. *Tomorrow's Modern Boxes* is definitely not the like the sounds from the album [Pablo Honey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002UR7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000002UR7&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=AG4M2GAUNAYSWZCO "Pablo Honey | Radiohead"), where *Creep* came from. It has some dance elements to it, on a very chill level, not up tempo at all. 

Listen to the first song before purchasing below.

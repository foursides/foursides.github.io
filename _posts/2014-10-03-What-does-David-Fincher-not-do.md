Another example of an artist working within restraints to create something magical and memorable. Fincher has directed some of my favourite films over the years: [Se7en](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XKVPG6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004XKVPG6&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=TYDDBADHUB4AFRQ5 "Se7en"), [Fight Club](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NUQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001992NUQ&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=WTK7MCXC4FRB5DKR "Fight Club"), [The Social Network](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P7Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0034G4P7Q&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=JPONPNXGFCO5S64I "The Social Network"), [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y5H5HY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003Y5H5HY&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=IW3AEZLPCJ3AQWQE "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"), and several more excellent films. Watching the short film below gives you a better appreciation for the artistic work he has been doing with his films over the past 20 years or so. 

It reminded me of the video Apple showed last year about [there are a thousand no's for every yes.](http://www.foursides.ca/saying-no/ "Saying No")

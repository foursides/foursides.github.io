> We’re coming up on the end of the year. The Earth gives us an opportunity to wake up earlier and go to sleep earlier. The Earth isn’t getting an operating system upgrade; it’s doing what it has always done. It’s preparing itself for a new year by shaking off the old one.

Writing has always been a therapeutic experience for me since I started scribbling in journals during University. Sitting down in front of a blank screen or empty journal page can be frightening for me when I don't know exactly what will pour out from my mind. Several years ago, I was much more in tune with that flow from my mind onto the digital page than I am now, and I wish to correct it. 

My weekly walks to explore different trails or lakefront have the dual purpose of getting exercise and relaxing my mind to help me get more in tune with myself. While the exercise has been great for me, having my mind flow into my writing has not been as productive as I would like. My paid work has been satisfactory; the personal, meaningful work has not. 

As the leaves change colour and fall to the ground, I received an email from [Gwen Bell](http://gwenbell.com "Gwen Bell") announcing a new project. The more I read, the more intrigued I became. Needless to say, I'm jumping into:

This past year has been full of challenges and great rewards. Working on this project over the next 31 days will help me focus more on my writing and develop a routine of daily writing again. There are different options in how to participate in this, so I invite you to join in my journey along with many others: [Bury Yourself](http://gwenbell.com "Gwen Bell | Bury Yourself")

### Ulysses 

By pure coincidence, there is also a 30 day trial for Ulyesses, a powerful writing app for Mac. I have heard about how great it is for the past year (mainly from [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net "Ben Brooks") ), and now I have the opportunity to give it a strong go. 

There are too many features to cover here, so I suggest heading over to their site to take a look around. Including in the trial is a free eBook by David Hewson that helps you get your project setup. You can use it to write a book, write all your blog posts and keep them organized, and more. I'm looking forward to giving it a good go for the next month, putting my preferred editor [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Qt "Byword" ) to the side for now.

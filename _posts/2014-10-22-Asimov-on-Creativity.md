> My feeling is that as far as creativity is concerned, isolation is required. The creative person is, in any case, continually working at it. His mind is shuffling his information at all times, even when he is not conscious of it. (The famous example of Kekule working out the structure of benzene in his sleep is well-known.)

> The presence of others can only inhibit this process, since creation is embarrassing. For every new good idea you have, there are a hundred, ten thousand foolish ones, which you naturally do not care to display.

A fascinating piece about creativity, written by Isaac Asimov in 1959. Previously unpublished, and only recently re-discovered by Arthur Obermayer. Not only is it about creativity, but also about where good ideas come from and how to foster them within groups. 

The last line of the quote above reminded me of the infamous Apple ad about [Saying No](http://www.foursides.ca/saying-no/ "Saying No - Four Sides"), 54 years after Asimov’s words.

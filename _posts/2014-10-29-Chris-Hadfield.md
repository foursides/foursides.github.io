> It occurred to me last year, ‘What is going to become of that treasure trove of self-awareness?’ It would be a waste if nobody ever saw it. So I went through all 45,000 and chose a few thousand. But I can’t publish a book with 3,000 photos, so I took this this as my precept: ‘If somebody who wanted to buy this book were at the window next to me, what would I show them if we were floating around the world once?'

Chris Hadfield is the Canadian astronaut who took the world by storm last year. He went viral on social media with his pictures, experiments, and his cover of David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity,’ becoming the world’s [most famous astronaut](http://qz.com/83986/how-chris-hadfield-unexpectedly-became-the-most-famous-astronaut-on-earth/ "How Chris Hadfield Became the Most Famous Astronaut on Earth"). He is now taking that fame to share his experiences with everyone for a good cause. 

[You Are Here: Around the World in 82 Minutes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316379646/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316379646&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=P6POQOE4UIY7XZ44 "You Are Here: Around the World in 82 Minutes") is a book of 192 full colour photographs taken from the International Space Station last year. Every continent is covered, except Anarctica, and includes captions explaining what we are seeing. 

The caption for the photo above of Egypt and Jerusalem is:
> All we know of our civilisation and history, everything from the Sphinx to what’s going on right now in Gaza, that’s all right there in one glance out of the window, brought to life by the lights of dusk. A fascinating part of the world to look at.

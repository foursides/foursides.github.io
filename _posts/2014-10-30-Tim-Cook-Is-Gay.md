Tim Cook announced that he was gay today in [Business Week](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay "Tim Cook is proud to be gay"). He laid a pretty large brick paving the way for others as the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world today. 

Everytime a step forward like this happens, whether it is a celebrity coming out or marriage equality spreading through the world, I can’t help but think back to junior high when a teenaged boy was brutally attacked for being gay in my hometown, or to a few girls I knew who were outcast from social groups for being bisexual or lesbian in high school. The world has definitely come a long way since those events happened over 15 years ago. 

When I entered University, gay culture was still tucked away and not truly out there. There were LGTB organizations and a newspaper (if I remember correctly), but I don’t recall seeing a lot of same-gender couples holding hands in the hallways and such. The one exception was in the Theatre Department that I essentially lived in for six years. That mini-world allowed an openess I have never encountered again. Sexuality was present and accepted in every form. 

I am happy that the walls of hate are coming down swiftly when it comes to sexuality. There is still a ways to go, however. By the time my daughter reaches University, I can only hope that the world is far more accepting of different genders and sexuality than it is today. 

We can only get there by building upon the bricks laid before us.

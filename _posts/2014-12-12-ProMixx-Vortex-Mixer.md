I recently saw a video on [Beyond Nutrition’s Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/v6vTU8QQw3/?modal=true "Instagram | Beyond Nutrition") account that made my eyes light up. It was of the [ProMixx Vortex Mixer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9XMNMQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00A9XMNMQ&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=NUPMGK7QOARMR4ON "ProMixx Vortex Mixer") in action. Very quiet, a gentle swirl begins at the bottom and then spreads upwards creating a funnel to mix everything up inside. I decided I had to go get one. 

It has turned into one of the best purchases of the year that I have made so far. 

After my [HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KFGLVWK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KFGLVWK&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=DFIDV6QIDIS74DQO "HIIT and Kettlebell Training BOX SET | Amazon") using [kettle bells](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TE9A9I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001TE9A9I&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=DMBIJTWOXHGJ5CUC "Kettlebells | Amazon"), I need to replenish my body and I generally don’t have time to prepare an actual meal. Protein shakes are the quickest and easiest thing for me to do. The problem is they can be a bit messy since they never mix up evenly for me. I thought about a blender, but that seemed a little expensive for what I needed. 

The ProMixx offers a few things that I could never get in a blender:

- it’s reasonably priced at under $30.00
- the blade at the bottom is small and easy to clean around
- the mixer is extremely portable, being the size of a 600mL bottle
- the motor takes two AAA batteries and is incredibly quiet, meaning I can mix up the protein shakes at night without waking up my daughter

It works very well for me, and has been very easy to clean up. I can easily fit my hand in to wipe around the bottle. Here is a video of it in action.

The protein powder going into it is [Revolution Whey Gainer Punch](http://www.revolution-nutrition.com/flavor-match/47-whey-gainer-punch.html "Revolution Whey Gainer Punch"). I have been using the usual vanilla or chocolate flavoured powders for years. My favourite (by far) has been [MusclePharm Combat Powder](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EHXKU2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004EHXKU2&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=OJLP4RK6RVKH63ZG "MusclePharm Combat Powder") - Cookies N Cream flavour. I switched to the punch partly for a change, partly for something lighter in taste that doesn’t taste horrible.

It gives me a lot more calories than other protein drinks, which I need since I tend to under eat when stressed. High protein, low sugar, and it tastes delicious. Definitely worth tracking down if you want to switch things up. The only downside is it is only available from independent supplement stores, so take a look at their site to find it. 

The ProMixx is more widely available, including Amazon. A great, reasonably priced Christmas present for your fitness enthusiast.

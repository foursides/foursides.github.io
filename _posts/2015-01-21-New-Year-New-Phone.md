After several years of watching people use large Android phones, Apple released their own larger phones this past October. Initially, I resisted diving in and buying one. I was rather content with the size and the camera of my two year-old iPhone 5, but then I started seeing the photographs of people using the newer phones and was greatly impressed. 

Seeing all the gorgeous images on [Instagram](http://www.instapaper.com/foursides "Foursides - Instapaper") helped nudge me in the right direction. What finally encouraged me to get it was the year-end sale that Telus[^1] was having on their devices. Saving nearly $100 on the phone was all I needed to go out and purchase the [iPhone 6](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NQGP5X2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00NQGP5X2&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=DR5FMEARVOSP6S53 "iPhone 6") (64GB, Space Grey).

There are many reviews of the phone out there that will be much more exhaustive than I could ever get into, but in short:

- the phone is beautiful out of the package and fits nicely in my hands
- camera is incredible
- battery life is as advertised, lasting for the better part of the day for me, whereas the iPhone 5 needed to be charged midday
- screen is gorgeous to read on and makes for a better reading experience than the 4” phones (iPhone 5, 5C, 5S)
- TouchID is a wonderful thing to have when using [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Qt "1Password"), especially. 

All that being said, I did find the phone to be a bit slick. I decided to go out and purchase a case for it, the [Spigen Tough Armor Case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JH88NHI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00JH88NHI&linkCode=as2&tag=four0b-20&linkId=VN4XWZJ7BXJSKOK4 "Spigen Tough Armor Case"). It does add a bit of weight to the phone, making it roughly the same weight as the iPhone 5, which is fine with me. It definitely improves upon how slick the phone felt before though. No concerns about dropping it[^2] now unless I am trying to juggle it around with other items in my hand. 

By far, the most impressive thing about the phone itself is the camera. I enjoyed using the iPhone 5 for pictures, but *love* taking photographs with the iPhone 6. 

Stay tuned for more pictures, apps I am loving, and more.

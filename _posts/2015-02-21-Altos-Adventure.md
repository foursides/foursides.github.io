Ever since purchasing my [new iPhone](http://www.foursides.ca/New-Year-New-Phone/ "New Year New Phone"), I’ve been discovering that playing games on the larger screen is a much better experience. 

Alto’s Adventure came out this week for iPhone. It’s an endless snowboarding game[^1], meaning the level only finishes when you crash. The game play is incredibly simple: a tap is a jump, pressing down causes you to flip. That’s it.

What sells me on the game is how beautiful it is. During the game, the light changes from sunlight to sunset to moonlight, making it a little more difficult as it gets darker. 

It is only $2.00 on the App Store, so check it out:

I've been quiet in my space[^1] here for several weeks for good reason. I've been reading and thinking a lot about the practice of mindfulness and Buddhism, which I hope to tackle more of in the coming weeks, but I also did something a little unexpected: I made a thing. 

I decided to take on a challenge being promoted by [Gumroad](http://www.Gumroad.com "Gumroad"), the online digital goods store. The challenge was to conceive, create, and publish something within ten days. I didn't go as deep into this challenge as other members of the challenge did (not posting in the group regularly or partnering up), but I did create something and pushed it out into the world. 

My creation is a short ebook to help introduce people to the world of vacation rentals. With me getting my property management license in the new year, I thought the book would be a good give-away to generate business for my [consulting services](http://www.foursidesconsulting.com "Four Sides Hospitality Consulting"). Around 10,000 words in length. In the coming weeks, I plan to create some spreadsheet tools that people can use to assist them in preparing for launching a vacation rental but I think this is a good start. 

It was my first real writing project that I have undertaken since my University days and I quite enjoyed the process. I couldn't think too much about what to write. I just did it. 

The frightening thing is it went so well for me, that I'm contemplating attempting the [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/ "NaNoWriMo") challenge to create a short novel in a month. I have three weeks to prepare for that so it may just happen. 

In the meantime, my book is free for now. Check it out and forward to friends if you know someone interested in it: [Vacation Rental Revolution](http://www.vacationrentalrevolution.com "Vacation Rental Revolution")

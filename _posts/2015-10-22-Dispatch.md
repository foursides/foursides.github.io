Starting a bit of a social experiment: publishing smaller pieces to Medium and working on lengthier pieces here. 

First one was published, [Dispatch](https://medium.com/@four_sides/dispatch-fc586deb2b62#.s7dxq2i04 "Dispatch"):

> I thought it fitting that the word dispatch has multiple meanings that can tie into Hume and my own exploratory writings. The definition of the word can mean a short message sent quickly, or the dismissal or rejection of something. Two things that I hope to accomplish with writing in this space.

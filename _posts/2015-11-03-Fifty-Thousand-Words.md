description: November is the month for NaNoWriMo where authors around the world publish a novel of 50,000 words. With no ideas for a novel, a different challenge has been accepted.

> I’ve known about NaNoWriMo for years, but the thing is: 50,000. That’s a big number, like almost an insurmountable number. I’ve never felt like I wanted to participate, but I always was impressed with those who did manage to at least try.

> So this year I am going to do it.
> But I’m not writing a novel.

When I [mentioned earlier](http://www.foursides.ca/i-made-a-thing "I Made a Thing - Four Sides") that I was considering taking up the NaNoWriMo novel challenge, I had similar thoughts as Ben. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed impossible for me to muster the creative energy to write that many words that flowed together in a logical manner. 50,000 words is not impossible if I allow myself the space to write about in a manner with more freedom. 

Towards the end of my [Dispatch](https://medium.com/@four_sides/dispatch-fc586deb2b62 "Dispatch") piece on Medium, I wrote about the ideas overflowing in my mind. Every day I open up Safari to see many tabs of articles I wish to touch on or that have inspired me in some way. I need a better habit of getting those ideas out into the world on a consistent basis. So for the month of November, I am going to try to publish 50,000 words between this site and Medium. In the end, I may bundle it all together. 

You can keep track of my progress, and what else I am up to on a new [Now](http://www.foursides.ca/now "Now - Four Sides") page which is a growing movement around the world.

> You know when a piece is finished, because you can’t pull out a single sentence or change a word or syllable. If you do extract that heavily polished sentence, you create a hole in the space between the sentences before and after it, since you have altered not only the sense but the sound that links those sentences.

Writing in this space has been a long process for me over the years, slowly evolving and changing as I’ve been more influenced by one author or style than another. The topics have changed as I’ve become more curious about other subjects or discovered different facets about a subject I was already keenly interested in. What hasn’t changed too much is the style of my writing. I can read something I wrote ten years ago and know that was me instantly. 

On one hand, that’s great that my voice hasn’t changed too much over the years; on the other, I wish I could notice a shift, some improvement. I’ve certainly read enough articles and books through the years about writing, but they must not have resonated enough with me to be translated into my writing. It wasn’t until I started reading [The Way of the Writer][2] that I realized why those other books haven’t resulted in better writing for me. The books and articles I was reading were focused more on being a more effective writer, not a *better* writer. 

[The Way of the Writer][3] comes with the subtitle of, “Reflections on the Art and Craft of Storytelling,” and it remains true to it. It’s a book of short essays and stories, full of quotes from other writers that have passed through or influenced Charles Johnson through the years, and anecdotes written in a way that both keep you engaged and teach you how to write better. I’m finding myself fascinated in the techniques he suggests using, from writing super long sentences to experiment with the flow of the words, to writing pieces with a focus on words that start with a select few letters. The highlights I’m making in this book are numerous, and I’ve just barely reached the halfway point. The bigger challenge is not highlighting the whole book. 

> The problem, as I see it, with vulgarity is that it is unexpressive, a failure of language to reveal things in a fresh way. Rather than liberate our perception, vulgarity calcifies it.

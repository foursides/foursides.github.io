Apple released a new ad today about the iPad. It's a striking ad, showing a variety of uses for the iPad. I've had mine for nearly two years now. I still find new ways to use and enjoy it, as does my daughter. I found it interesting how the iPads were being used in sports like sumo and hockey, or using it to film things in the wild. 

When I saw it on television, I thought I recognized the voice and the quote. Only after browsing through the internet did I find out what it was. A scene from [Dead Poet's Society](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073XYLUC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0073XYLUC&linkCode;=as2&tag;=four0b-20 "Dead Poet's Society"):

Here is the full quote from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/quotes?item=qt0437444 "IMDB"):

> We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, “O me! O life!… of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless… of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?” Answer. That you are here — that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?

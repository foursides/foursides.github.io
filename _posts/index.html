<p>The two unfixables in life are: aging and dying. You can’t fix those. </p>

<p>— Atul Gawande</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The day before I start publishing the <a href="http://www.foursides.ca/Bury-Yourself-Writing-Project/" title="Bury Yourself">Bury Yourself</a> project, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/" title="PBS Frontline">PBS Frontline</a> has released the trailer for a new episode airing in the new year. It’s based upon the book by Atul Gawande, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805095152/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805095152&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=four0b-20&amp;linkId=4NQGCHU6GJPZMULN" title="Being Mortal">Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</a>. </p>

<p>Atul Gawande is a practicing doctor, which makes the book and the Frontline episode that much more appealing to me. Here is the book blurb and the trailer for the episode below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Being Mortal, bestselling author Atul Gawande tackles the hardest challenge of his profession: how medicine can not only improve life but also the process of its ending</p>

<p>Medicine has triumphed in modern times, transforming birth, injury, and infectious disease from harrowing to manageable. But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering.</p>
